John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

Task
Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

    const result = Math.ceil((wallS + reserve) / rollS);
    return numbers[result];
